h3. About the Free Keynote UX Stencils

These are a collection of UI elements I've created while using keynote to do interactive wireframes and rapid prototyping for "ChallengePost":http://www.challengepost.com . 

h3. What do they look like?

Take a look at the images here:

h3. How to use the Keynote Wireframe Templates

I created this template in Keynote '09 and I have no idea if it will work in earlier versions of Keynote.

h4. Adding these stencils as a keynote theme

* Open up Keynote-UX-Stencils.key and click File -> "Save Theme"

h3. Helping with this project

If you want to add some elements you've made, send me a message colin.nederkoorn [at] gmail, or you can fork the project on github :)

Enjoy!
